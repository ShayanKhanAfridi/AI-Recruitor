✅ REPLIT SUPER PROMPT (FULL INTERVIEW SYSTEM — FRONTEND + BACKEND)

Build a fully functional AI Interview System with frontend + backend.
The goal is to create a separate interview web app (apart from the HR dashboard).
This app will be accessed only through a unique link sent to each candidate.

🎯 Core Requirements
1. Tech Stack

Use:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (clean components)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: SQLite (or simple JSON storage if easier)

Video / Mic: use browser getUserMedia() (no third-party API required)

🎫 Interview Link & Authentication

Create a system where:

Admin generates a unique InterviewID + Password pair

Candidate receives a link like:

/interview/:interviewId


When candidate opens the link, a login page shows:

Interview ID (auto-filled)

Password (candidate enters)

After login:

Verify credentials from database

Check if current time is within allowed interview time

If expired → show “Access Expired” page

Candidate can only enter once and only within the scheduled time window.

⏳ Time-Limited Interview Access

Each interview entry includes:

{
  interviewId,
  password,
  candidateName,
  startTime,
  endTime,
  isUsed: false
}


Rules:

If before startTime → show “Interview not started yet”

If after endTime → show “Link expired”

When candidate logs in → mark isUsed = true (optional)

Countdown timer in UI:

Show "Remaining Time: 14:32"

When time ends → auto logout + disable UI

🎥 Interview Room UI Requirements

Create a fully designed interview screen with:

Left Side: Candidate Camera Feed

Large video window

Mic on/off indicator

Camera on/off indicator

Right Side: AI Panel

Question displayed

User answer text (for debugging)

Placeholder area for future AI transcripts

“Next Question” button (dummy action)

Top Bar

Candidate Name

Interview Role

Countdown timer

Exit button

Bottom Controls

Start Interview button

End Interview button

Mute / Unmute

Camera On / Off

🌐 Pages Required
1. Landing Page

Simple page explaining:
“Welcome to AI Interview System — Powered by Replit”

2. Login Page

Fields:

Interview ID (pre-filled)

Password

"Begin Interview" Button

3. Interview Page

Full UI as described above.

4. Expired / Not Started Page

Show appropriate message.

📁 Folder Structure

Replit should generate:

/public
   /css
   /js
   /img
   index.html
   login.html
   interview.html
   expired.html

/server
   server.js
   database.js
   routes.js

/interviews.json   (stores interview data)

📡 Backend API Endpoints
POST /api/auth

Validate ID + Password

Check schedule window

Respond with success or error

GET /api/interview/:id

Get interview info

🧪 Dummy Interview Logic

Create a placeholder array:

[
 "Tell me about yourself.",
 "Why do you want this job?",
 "What are your strengths?",
 "Describe a challenge you overcame."
]


Display 1 question at a time.

🎨 UI Style

Use:

Clean white background

Light grey borders

Blue accents (#2563eb or similar)

Modern SaaS style (Notion / Linear / Figma vibes)

Rounded components

Smooth spacing

Responsive layout

No unnecessary animations

⚠️ IMPORTANT

Make the system fully working end-to-end WITHOUT AI integration for now.
Only structure and architecture should be prepared so AI can be added later.
